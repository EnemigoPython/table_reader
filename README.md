# table_reader
A quick HTML table reader I cooked up using ChatGPT.

## about
Use this simple tool to import table HTML (just the `<table>...</table>` bit). This tool will index it & provide search functionality.

Only tested so far on the example table (blender cheat sheet).

I directly wrote almost none of this, it is mostly the result of prompting ChatGPT & a little bit of refactoring of the output code.

My favourite part is the free nice CSS!
